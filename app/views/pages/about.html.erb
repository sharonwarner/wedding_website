      <p>Sharon and Eric met while living in the Haverford College Apartments in the summer of 2009. For the former, at least, it was most definitely not love at first site as that person, i.e., Sharon Warner, viewed the latter, i.e., Eric Chesterton, as a mere medium through which she might pursue her romantic interests in a third party. </p>
      <p>After that courtship proved fruitless, Eric, ever charming and witty, proved himself to be a suitable partner for Sharon. Since that time--we'll call the ensuing era the Enlightenment, just to keep things simple--things went swimmingly for the couple, proving that Eric was right all along. Take note, dear reader, as this will be a recurring theme in our tale.</p>
      <p>Our protagonists found in each other...something. Some couples have been described as matches made in heaven, or soul mates. Those idyllic images, I can assure you, do not apply to the couple presently under scrutiny. Eric and Sharon's relationship is very much a product of the world's craft, bearing numerous idiosyncrasies as its mark. </p>

      <p>Most notable of these, i.e., the ideosyncracies, and most relevant, and most relevant to the endeavor which's completion this site anticipates. In November of 2012, Sharon was in the first semester of a master's program at the University of Pittsburgh and Eric was in his second year tutoring in Ardmore. With their third anniversary upcoming, Eric decided to propose; however, he lacked the logistical means to travel to Pittsburgh. </p>
      <p>Fortunately, the 21st is the century in which he resided and, with a thorough search of the internet marketplace Overstock.com, Eric procured a ring--for an incredible bargain, he might add--and had it shipped to Sharon in Pittsburgh. When Sharon received the package, Eric instructed her to wait until he got home from work so that they could open it together over Google Hangout as it was a special gift for their anniversary. Little did she know (oh, well, she knew. It wasn't that hard to figure out, after all) that contained within that box was the finest ring Overstock.com had to offer. Sharon feigned surprise upon opening the box, said she would enter into the verbal contract signified by the ring, and put the ring on. As it turns out, the ring was many sizes too big. It has not been resized because rings are stupid anyway. </p>
      <p>And here we are today, nearly 3 years later, preparing to fulfill the promise made by the ill-fitting Overstock.com ring between, at least from Google's perspective, pixel Sharon and pixel Eric.
      Real Sharon and real Eric are excited to achieve a relationship milestone in person for once with friends and family, instead of hackers lost in the labyrinthine halls of the internet, as witness.</p>
